// All Satellite Data is stored as discrete pixels, and that means it can be reffered as categorical, Right?
// No, The quantitative variables will have to be determined for each dataset to determine which lines of code to use 
// This is crucial because for the coding language GEE uses, the same code that works for one satellite data like (landsat) and (Global ALot mTPI) will not work.
// So .sampleregion is used for continuous dataset and .Reduceregion is used for Discrete dataset.

// * Now classify if your dataset is static or dynamic; if static you will only need to download it once because the values are fixed independently of time*
// * This dataset was created in 2020 which isn't alot of time compared to 2024/2025 (landuse wise), therefore, i assumed it to be constant)*
// * in contrast, Dynamic will change with time therefore the time will need to be recorded in the CSV file *

// ** There should be other CSV files and not all into one because it's not just easier to detect error but also **
// ** Conserve information as GEE will resample using nearest-neighbor interpolation which is the opposite of untampered data**
